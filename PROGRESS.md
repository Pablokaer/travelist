## M0 — Done

- pnpm workspaces + Turborepo (`lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `build:web`), Prettier, EditorConfig, Node 22.
- `apps/mobile`: Expo SDK 57, Expo Router, typed routes, React Compiler; tabs (Explore / My Trips / Profile) + About (data sources) + 404; light/dark theme tokens; EN/PT via i18next with device-locale detection and a working language switch; zod-validated public env; TanStack Query provider; observability facade (no-op without keys).
- `packages/shared`: constants (categories, default visit minutes, visa enum, route limits), base zod schemas, EN/PT resources with key-parity tests.
- `supabase/`: CLI config (redirect URLs for web + `wayfarer://`), migration enabling PostGIS + `set_updated_at()`, pgTAP smoke tests (incl. "RLS enabled on every public table"), `health` Edge Function with Deno tests.
- `data-pipeline/`: Python package, validated `cities.yaml` with all 12 launch cities (ids/centres/bboxes from Wikidata + Nominatim), CLI (`validate-config`, `ingest` stub), pytest + ruff.
- CI: app (format, lint, typecheck, unit, web export, Playwright), database (migrations, pgTAP, `db lint`), functions (deno lint/fmt/test), pipeline (ruff, pytest).
- Security CI (D-049): CodeQL (TS/JS, Python), dependency review, gitleaks, pnpm audit + pip-audit, actionlint — on every PR, on `main` and weekly.
- Docs: README, ARCHITECTURE, DECISIONS (D-001…D-010), DATA_SOURCES.

**Verified locally (cloud dev container):** `pnpm check` green (Jest 5 tests, Vitest 6 tests), `expo export -p web` OK, Playwright 4/4 (desktop + mobile viewport), `supabase start` + `supabase test db` 4/4, `health` function responds via the local gateway, `supabase db lint` clean, pytest 8/8, deno test 2/2.

**Not verified here:** iOS simulator and Android emulator runs (need macOS/Android tooling) — run `pnpm dev` and press `i` / `a`.

## M1–M4 — Done (2026-09-28)

- **Database:** reference tables (countries, cities, attractions with PostGIS, visa rules, api_cache) and user tables (profiles, nationalities, trips, trip stops) with RLS; RPCs `attractions_in_view`, `set_nationalities`, `save_trip`, `delete_account`; profile created on sign-up; pgTAP: 24 tests.
- **Data:** 250 countries (plugs, voltage, currency, calling code, emergency numbers, languages), 80 cities in 32 countries (12 at launch + 68 added 2026-09-28; list in [docs/CITIES.md](./docs/CITIES.md)), 39,402 visa rules, 14,222 attractions (≤ 300 per city) with images, licences, opening hours and popularity. Committed as SQL seeds (D-011).
- **Edge Functions:** `checklist` (visa, passport validity, power, Open-Meteo weather, FX, Canada advisories, practical info, each degrading independently, cached) and `route-optimize` (ORS + fallback). Both require a signed-in user (D-015). Deno: 40 tests.
- **App:** email/password, magic link + 6-digit code, Google/Apple (PKCE; native Apple on iOS), protected routes, 3-step onboarding, profile edit, language/units, account deletion; Explore with MapLibre map (web + native), city switcher, category filters, accessible list view, attraction detail with image credit; checklist screen; route tray (≤ 12 stops at the time; 20 since D-030), optimisation, totals, save trip; My Trips list/detail/delete with Google/Apple Maps walking links. Jest: 12 tests. Playwright: smoke + full journey (sign-up → onboarding → checklist → route → saved trip) on desktop and mobile viewports.
- **Verified locally (macOS, 2026-09-28):** `pnpm check`, `pnpm db:test`, `supabase db lint`, Deno lint/fmt/test, pytest (76) + ruff, `pnpm build:web`, `E2E_BACKEND=1 pnpm e2e` 6/6, map rendering on web (screenshots), live checklist for Lisbon with real providers.

## 2026-09-28 — 20 more cities

Berlin, Venice, Florence, Munich, Dublin, Athens, Budapest, Edinburgh, Brussels, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Nice, Seville, Kraków, Warsaw, Naples, Valencia, Zurich, Antalya, Oslo (same limits and filters as the launch cities). Fixes found on the way: YAML `NO` → `false` (quoted + test); GR/PL/SE language overrides; category roots for sculptures, parliament buildings and promenades, and archaeological ruins no longer dropped as "destroyed structures" (Parthenon); class-root cache invalidated when roots change; HTTP client wall-clock deadline (WDQS trickling responses hung ingestion for > 1 h). Cities below the 300 cap have fewer notable places in their area: Nice 64, Antalya 28.

## 2026-09-28 — 20 more cities (batch 3)

Hamburg, Frankfurt, Cologne, Geneva, Salzburg, Bruges, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Helsinki, Reykjavík, Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius, Dubrovnik, Split, Ljubljana, Bratislava, Palma, Málaga, Bologna. Hamburg and Palma use centre-based bboxes (boundaries include a North Sea island / open sea). LT and SI country overrides. Concert halls added as a category root (Elbphilharmonie); all 52 cities re-ingested under the same rules. Most of these cities are smaller: only Helsinki reaches the 300 cap; Dubrovnik has 40. Known gap: Riga's House of the Blackheads is typed only as "building" on Wikidata, too generic to include.

## 2026-09-28 — 8 more cities (batch 4: EU and UK capitals)

Sofia, Zagreb, Nicosia, Luxembourg, Valletta, Bucharest, Cardiff, Belfast — with these, every EU member state's capital and every UK nation capital is covered (asserted by `test_all_eu_and_uk_capitals_are_covered`). Valletta (1 km² municipality) and Cardiff (Nominatim returned a node) use centre-based bboxes. City halls added as a category root; all 60 cities re-ingested (+35 attractions in existing cities). CY override: 1400 is not an emergency line. Smaller cities: Nicosia 47, Belfast 76, Luxembourg 92, Sofia 98.

## 2026-09-28 — 20 more cities (batch 5: secondary cities)

Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, Turin, Verona, Pisa, Granada, Bilbao, Córdoba, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, York, Gdańsk, Wrocław, Dresden, Innsbruck, Ghent, Bergen, Gothenburg — no new countries. Córdoba (1,250 km² mostly rural municipality) and Gothenburg (municipality includes the outer archipelago) use centre-based bboxes; Manchester, Liverpool and York OSM relations came from Nominatim (no P402 on Wikidata). Fix: items with a second Wikidata coordinate in another city are seeded where OSM confirms them (Madrid Arena). French communes are small, so counts are low: Bordeaux 58, Marseille 85. Known gaps: Bergen's Bryggen is typed "architectural ensemble" (too broad to include: its subclasses cover hamlets and schools); Marseille's Vieux-Port is a seaport.

## 2026-09-28 — UI redesign (D-020)

Design system (tokens, Inter, shared components with hover/focus/press/loading states) and every screen reworked: Explore card grid with floating Map/List switch and route tray, attraction hero with sticky CTA, desktop map-beside-list for route and trip detail, card grid for trips, grouped profile, two-column checklist, centred auth. Bottom tabs on phones, side rail on desktop. Verified on web at desktop and phone widths (unit tests + full E2E journey); native rendering not yet checked.

## 2026-09-29 — Attraction reviews (D-028)

1–5 star ratings with optional comments on every attraction, average + count next to the name, one review per user (edit / delete own only). Postgres table with RLS, `save_review` / `list_attraction_reviews` RPCs and `attraction_rating_summary` view; 24 pgTAP tests, unit/component tests and an E2E journey (publish → edit → delete) on web.

## 2026-09-29 — Photo markers on the city map (D-029)

Places on the city map are round photo markers; a first tap opens the compact List card over the map (+ adds to the route, tapping the card opens the place). Unit/component tests plus an E2E journey on desktop and phone widths.

## 2026-09-29 — Up to 20 stops per route (D-030)

Routes hold 2–20 stops (was 12): tray, `route-optimize` schema, `save_trip` and `trip_stops` (migration). Exact order up to 12 stops, nearest neighbour + 2-opt for 13–20; the split keeps ≤ 6 routes with work caps. Tests at every layer and an E2E that fills a route to 20, sees the 21st refused and saves the trip.

## 2026-09-29 — Walk list visibility and sharing (D-031)

Saved trips are private (default), public or password-protected; the owner switches between them and shares the link (`/shared?id=…`), which opens read-only for anyone allowed, signed in or not. pgTAP: 28 tests (RLS, hashes unreadable, owner-only changes, anon access); unit/component tests; an E2E that goes private → public (link copied and opened signed out) → password (wrong, then right) → private, on desktop and phone widths.

## 2026-09-29 — Rating filter on city pages (D-032)

★ 3+ / 4+ / 5+ tabs after the category tabs keep only places whose average rating reaches the minimum (grid, map, count); unrated places are hidden while one is active. Unit/component tests; verified with `pnpm check`, not yet on a device.

## 2026-09-29 — City page hub, community walk lists, city reviews (D-033 – D-036)

Home cards open the city page `/short/{slug}` (hero, Wikipedia About, community and official walk lists, Before you go, reviews); **Explore attractions** leads to the unchanged `/city/{slug}`. Reviews generalised to cities and walk lists (`reviews` table); public lists are listed, searched, sorted and saved (`list_walklists`, `saved_trips`); moderators mark lists official. pgTAP: 43 new tests (129 in all); pipeline: 6 new tests; app: unit/component/router tests (215 in all); E2E: `city-page.spec.ts` (city review, a public list found, saved and rated by a second traveller) on desktop and phone widths.

## 2026-09-29 — Demo community data (D-037)

`pnpm db:demo <city>` loads local test data for the city page feed: six friends writing in EN/ES/FR plus a "Wayfarer Team" moderator. Done: **Amsterdam**, with 6 city reviews, 35 reviews of 10 places, 9 community and 4 official walk lists, 42 list ratings and 12 saves, checked by `amsterdam.check.sql`. Next: the other cities, one `supabase/demo/<city>.sql` + `.check.sql` each.

## 2026-09-29 — Walk list cover photo (D-038)

Walk list cards (My Trips, city page, View all) show the starting point's photo with its credit, through `walklist_cover(trip)`, which `list_walklists` returns and My Trips reads as a computed column. pgTAP: 6 new tests (135 in all); app: 6 new tests (221 in all). Checked in the web app with the Amsterdam demo data.

## 2026-09-29 — Profile photo (D-039)

Users add, change and remove a profile photo on Edit profile. It is cropped to a square, resized to 512 px and uploaded to the public `avatars` bucket (per-user folder policies), and shown on the Profile screen and next to their reviews. pgTAP: 9 new tests (144 in all); app: 10 new tests (231 in all). Verified on web: upload, change (old file deleted), remove, and the photo on another user's view of the reviews. Next: check the native picker on iOS/Android; the author photo on walk list cards.

## 2026-09-29 — Walk meetups (D-041)

Walk lists can have a date and time (city time); the city page ranks the next public meetups with a countdown, `/short/{slug}/meetups` lists them by day, and travellers say "I'm going". pgTAP: 27 new tests (184 in all); shared: time-zone and countdown tests (DST included); app: 254 tests; E2E: a meetup created by one traveller and joined by another, desktop and phone widths.

## 2026-09-29 — Scheduled data refresh and data gate (D-042)

- **Monthly** refresh of countries, visa rules, city texts and attractions as a pull request, behind a data gate that restores texts, photos and facts that got worse and blocks big losses. The same gate runs in CI on every PR.
- **Weekly** live check of the weather, exchange-rate and advisory providers.
- **Tests:** pipeline 24 new (128 in all), Edge Functions 3 new.
- **Verified locally:** the gate on real data with injected damage (disambiguation text, a Q-id name, a lost photo, lost plugs, Porto −40%), a real `city-summaries` fetch with gate and seed in a scratch worktree, and the live check against the real APIs. The workflows pass `actionlint` but have not run on GitHub yet (no remote).
- **Next:** a maintained visa source; publishing merged data to the hosted project.

## 2026-09-29 — Walk list group chat (D-043)

Going to a meetup opens its group chat with the organiser and everyone else going; messages arrive instantly through Supabase Realtime (RLS-checked per subscriber). pgTAP: 21 new tests (205 in all); app: 263 tests; E2E: two browsers exchange messages without reloading, desktop and phone widths (26 E2E in all).

## 2026-09-29 — Walk list participation and chat audit (D-044)

Reproduced with three users: lost Realtime events hid messages (root cause), joining was not idempotent and failed silently, and lists without a future time could not be joined. Fixed with server reconciliation (re-read on open/focus/every 10 s), `set_walk_attendance`, joining any public list and a participants list. pgTAP: 34 new tests (239 in all); app: 275 tests; E2E: three browsers share one live chat that survives a reload (28 E2E in all); validated with Realtime restarted and stopped.

## 2026-09-29 — Public traveller profiles (D-045)

Authors' names on reviews and chat messages open their public profile (photo, name, member since, public walk lists) by a public id that is not the account id. pgTAP: 16 new tests (255 in all); app: 283 tests; E2E: a chat author and a reviewer opened by another traveller, desktop and phone widths (30 E2E in all).

## 2026-09-29 — Walking routes along the streets (D-046)

Straight-line routes reproduced (ORS optimisation over quota: 403) and fixed with a cascade: optimisation → local order + ORS foot-walking directions → straight lines only as a last resort; three real-API issues found and covered by regression tests (406 without the GeoJSON Accept, 404 for stops far from a footway, no segments without instructions). Manual order is kept. Deno: 56 tests; app: 288; E2E: a route checked on the real ORS and on the map (32 E2E in all).

## 2026-09-29 — Free and Premium plans, first version (D-047)

`plans` (the single source of the limits) and `subscriptions` (history, status, provider ids) tables; Free: 5 lists, 5 places per list, no deleting; Premium: €5/month, unlimited, deletes own lists. Enforced by database triggers and `delete_trip`; the app explains the limits (Upgrade, Plans page, Settings → Subscription). No payments yet. pgTAP: 31 new tests (286 in all); shared: plan rules; app: 312 tests; E2E: Free limits in the app and the database, then Premium (34 E2E in all).

## 2026-09-29 — Nicknames (D-048)

- **What:** a nickname at sign-up (or in onboarding and Edit profile), sign-in with **Email or nickname**, and `@nickname` on every walk chat message, yours included.
- **Tests:** pgTAP 19 new, shared 4 new, app 13 new or updated (325 in all).
- **Verified on web:** Lucía signed in as `Lucia` and Emma as `emma`; each sees their own messages as `@nickname` and the other's replies with that person's nickname.

## 2026-10-03 — Performance audit and fixes (D-050 – D-060)

- **Measured first** (production web build, local stack, rolled-back load tests in Postgres), then fixed with tests: photos at the width they are shown (Home 11.1 → 1.35 MiB before scrolling), category filters on the device, Edge Function tokens verified locally plus a memory cache and parallel reads (warm checklist 30 → 6.8 ms), rating totals kept by triggers (walk list previews 85–210 → 0.5 ms at 20k lists), incremental chat re-reads, trip pages in one request, zod locales and fonts out of the web start (bundle 2,752 → 2,383 KiB, fonts 2.28 MB → 460 KiB), a faster exact walking order with identical results, and cities ingested side by side.
- **Corrected:** the audit's map finding did not hold once measured with GPU rendering and warm tiles (300 photo markers pan at 60 fps); the 60-marker cap was reverted and only memoised markers kept (D-051).
- **Tests:** pgTAP 18 files (335), app 50 suites (359), shared 117, Edge Functions 65, pipeline 130.
- **Next:** profile iOS/Android (Hermes, MapLibre native markers) on devices; "Suggest a split" still blocks the JS thread for up to ~1.7 s at 20 stops; switch the hosted project to asymmetric JWT keys so tokens are verified locally there too.

## 2026-10-03 — Performance audit, second pass (D-061 – D-064)

- **Database:** walk list pages, sorts, saved lists, reviews and rating summaries read only what they show (offset 1000 ~100 → ~2 ms, saved 36 → 0.5 ms, a list's reviews 9 → 0.2 ms), with identical results; the chat's people update on join/leave instead of a 30 s poll.
- **App:** 60 px marker photos (~2.5 → ~1.0 MiB per city), search indexed once per city, attraction header from cache, city places preloaded, one card re-render per stop toggle, one minute clock for countdowns, MapLibre CSS only with the map.
- **Edge Functions:** cache writes after the response, a circuit breaker for ORS and failing slow sources, one forecast call per place and day.
- **Pipeline:** ~47% fewer Wikidata queries per full run (same output), 90 s Wikidata timeout, 2 parallel queries, class cache kept in CI.
- **Next:** check the chat's live join/leave announcements in a browser and on devices; decide on removing reanimated / worklets / gesture-handler with a native build (D-062).

## 2026-10-03 — Chat and paid plans hidden, limits lifted, email service (D-065, D-066)

- **Product (D-065):** walk group chat and paid plans UI hidden behind `EXPO_PUBLIC_FEATURE_*` flags (code and backend kept); Free-plan limits lifted in the database and the app — unlimited lists, 20 places per list, owners delete their lists.
- **Email (D-066):** welcome email in the user's language after onboarding; password recovery end to end (**Forgot password?** → email with link → new password → signed in); every auth email goes through our `auth-email` function (Send Email Hook) to Resend (production) or Mailpit (local). Verified locally with Playwright and Mailpit (PT welcome, EN reset, magic link with code).
- **Next:** Resend account + verified domain and the hosted Send Email Hook (LAUNCH_CHECKLIST #8); universal links so `wayfarer://` email links are clickable on iOS/Android.

## Remaining (M5 and launch)

- Native iOS/Android runs not verified here: this machine has no Xcode/Android SDK. Build with `expo run:ios|android` or EAS (`eas.json` included).
- Route stop drag and drop (D-027) is verified on web only; check it on iOS/Android with a development build (gesture vs page scroll).
- Map: clustering for dense areas; check photo markers and the card popup on iOS/Android (D-029).
- Walk list sharing: limit password attempts; revoke a link without going private; check the native share sheet on iOS/Android (D-031).
- Reviews: "load more" beyond the 50 newest, reporting / moderation (D-028); city and walk list reviews share the same gap (D-034).
- Plans: payment provider (checkout, webhooks writing `subscriptions`, renewal, cancellation, billing portal) (D-047); decide the plan limits before turning `EXPO_PUBLIC_FEATURE_PAID_PLANS` back on (D-065).
- Routes: rebuild trips saved earlier as straight-line estimates; a higher ORS quota for launch (D-046).
- Meetups: reminders/notifications and a time picker (D-041); chat push notifications, message reporting/moderation and older-message paging (D-043); turn the walk chat back on (`EXPO_PUBLIC_FEATURE_WALK_CHAT`, D-065).
- Walk lists: an admin screen for moderators (today: SQL), a count of lists on the city page, and a check of the city page on iOS/Android (D-033, D-035).
- Offline-lite (persisted query cache with MMKV) is not implemented yet.
- Sentry / PostHog SDKs are not wired (facade ready; needs DSN/keys).
- Native date pickers (D-019) and a map-beside-list layout for Explore on wide screens (D-007) are post-MVP polish; route and trip detail already use it (D-020).
- Owner-only items (accounts, keys, store listings): see [docs/LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](./docs/LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md).

## Known issues / open questions

- **Without `ORS_API_KEY`** routes are straight-line estimates (clearly labelled in the UI).
- **Bundle id** `com.travelist.app` is a placeholder (D-001).
- Portuguese attraction names exist for ~15–55% of places outside Portugal/Rome; the English name is shown as fallback.
- Opening hours come from OSM and cover ~15–30% of places.
- Expo Go cannot load MapLibre; a development build is required.
